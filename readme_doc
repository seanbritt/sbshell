	     Thank you for using myShell!


to use myShell, simply type a command and enter.  builtins are 
listed below, but common shell programs like ls and ps can be 
run as well.  

at "myShell> ", type the command you want to run followed by 
any arguments you wish to pass the command.  mode flags,
including &, <, >, >>, and |, can used to create strings of
commands, discussed after builtin commands. 



available builtin commands:
	
	cd: 	prints the current directory

		-optional argument: the directory to move to

	
	dir: 	prints the contents of the current directory
		
		-optional argument: the directory to print 


	clr: 	clears the screen of the terminal

	
	environ: prints the environment variables


	echo: 	prints the command line following echo


	help: 	prints this help file!


	pause: 	waits until the user types enter


	quit: 	exits myShell



optional flags:
	
	|	used for piping between commands.  in the case of 
		com1 | com2, send output of com1 to input of com 2

	>,>>,<	used for redirecting output of a command to a file.
		the command is always on the open side of the bracket.
		so com1 > out.txt sends the output of com1 to the file
		out.txt. if out.txt does not exist, it is created. if it
		exists, it is overwritten for > or <. for >>, the file 
		is appended.

	&	used to string commands and run each in the background. 
		com1 & com2 will allow com1 to run simultaneously with 
		com2.
